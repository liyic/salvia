Napa needs the help of [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org). Suppose you have downloaded both CommonMark and Napa in your `js` folder.

Simply add following lines in your page:

```markup
<script src="./js/commonmark.min.js"></script>
<script src="./js/napa.js"></script>
```

Congrats! You have geared up to create a blog with Napa! Continue read this post to learn how to create different blog components.

## Feed

Feed page is usually your home page. People would see a list of your posts. Usually you don't want to show full post contents to your visitor in this page.

Construct HTML markups:

```markup
<header id="header"></header>
<main id="feed"></main>
<footer id="footer"></footer>
```

Then script up:

```javascript
let blog = new Napa({
    el: {
        header: '#header',
        feed: '#feed',
        footer: '#footer'
    }
});
```

Your page is ready!
